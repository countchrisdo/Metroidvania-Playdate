# Metroidvania PD
##  A 2D platformer game made for Playdate 
- Based on https://github.com/SquidGodDev/MetroidvaniaTutorial 
- Images adaptaded from Kenny's 1-Bit platformer https://kenney.nl/assets/1-bit-platformer

## Notes


## Ideas

### Graphics
- The 16x16 tileset is a bit small for the screen. We should try to make it like 32x32 or even 24x24

### LDTK
- Use LDTK Entities to set player spawn point
